# Setup CLI

Users interact with the Setup CLI to complete the final stages of setting up their developer environment.

Run-time environment(s), git, and oh-my-bash must be installed prior to this step.

The scripts can append the Python path commands to your `.bashrc`, migrate your custom oh-my-bash theme to your oh-my-bash themes folder, and setup your global `.gitignore` file.

## Prerequesites
Clone the repo to your local machine.

If you're using a custom oh-my-bash theme, save a copy of your theme to `./setup-cli`. If you'd like to use my theme, you don't need to do anything.

## Using the CLI
To interact with the CLI, execute the following command:
```sh
    ./setup-cli.sh
```

Then navigate through the prompts.

Hit `Ctrl + c` at any time to exit.
